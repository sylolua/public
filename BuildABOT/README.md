# Public Scripts

## About
These scripts are created by various users. However, I have saved them here for the following reasons:
- The original owner deleted the loadstring.
- The script had a key system that I have removed for easier access.

Simply copy and execute the scripts as needed. Be sure to use a compatible executor.
